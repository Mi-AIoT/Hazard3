== Instruction Pseudocode

This section is a quick reference for the operation of the instructions supported by Hazard3, in Verilog syntax. Conventions used in this section:

* `rs1`, `rs2` and `rd` are 32-bit unsigned vector variables referring to the two register operands and the destination register
* `imm` is a 32-bit unsigned vector referring to the instruction's immediate value
* `pc` is a 32-bit unsigned vector referring to the program counter
* `mem` is an array of 8-bit unsigned vectors, each corresponding to a byte address in memory.

=== RV32I: Register-register

With the exception of the shift instructions, all instructions in this section have an immediate range of -2048 to 2047. Negative immediates can be useful for the bitwise operations too: for example `not rd, rs1` is a pseudo-op for `xori rd, rs1, -1`.

Shift instructions have an immediate range of 0 to 31.
