== Introduction

Hazard3 is a 3-stage RISC-V processor, providing the following architectural support:

* `RV32I`: 32-bit base instruction set
* `M`: integer multiply/divide/modulo
* `A`: atomic memory operations
* `C`: compressed instructions
* `Zba`: address generation
* `Zbb`: basic bit manipulation
* `Zbc`: carry-less multiplication
* `Zbs`: single-bit manipulation
* M-mode privileged instructions `ECALL`, `EBREAK`, `MRET`
* The `WFI` instruction
* `Zicsr`: CSR access
* The machine-mode (M-mode) privilege state, and standard M-mode CSRs
* Debug support, fully compliant with version 0.13.2 of the RISC-V external debug specification

The following are planned for future implementation:

* Trigger unit for debug mode
** Likely breakpoints only
