== Instruction Cycle Counts

All timings are given assuming perfect bus behaviour (no stalls). Stalling of the `I` bus can delay execution indefinitely, as can stalling of the `D` bus during a load or store.

=== M Extension

Timings assume the core is configured with `MULDIV_UNROLL = 2` and `MUL_FAST = 1`. I.e. the sequential multiply/divide circuit processes two bits per cycle, and a separate dedicated multiplier is present for the `mul` instruction.

=== C Extension

All C extension 16-bit instructions on Hazard3 are aliases of base RV32I instructions. They perform identically to their 32-bit counterparts.

A consequence of the C extension is that 32-bit instructions can be non-naturally-aligned. This has no penalty during sequential execution, but branching to a 32-bit instruction that is not 32-bit-aligned carries a 1 cycle penalty, because the instruction fetch is cracked into two naturally-aligned bus accesses.
