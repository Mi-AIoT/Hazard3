=== M Extension

Timings assume the core is configured with `MULDIV_UNROLL = 2` and `MUL_FAST = 1`. I.e. the sequential multiply/divide circuit processes two bits per cycle, and a separate dedicated multiplier is present for the `mul` instruction.

A stall would be inserted between `lr.w` and `sc.w` anyhow, so the local monitor can be updated based on the `lr.w` data phase in time to suppress the `sc.w` address phase.]

|`amoswap.w rd, rs2, (rs1)` | 4+ | 4 per attempt. Multiple attempts if reservation is lost.footnote:amo_timing[AMOs are issued as a paired exclusive read and exclusive write on the bus, at the maximum speed of 2 cycles per access, since the bus does not permit pipelining of exclusive reads/writes. If the write phase fails due to the global monitor reporting a lost reservation, the instruction loops at a rate of 4 cycles per loop, until success. If the read reservation is refused by the global monitor, the instruction generates a Store/AMO Fault exception, to avoid an infinite loop.]

=== C Extension

All C extension 16-bit instructions are aliases of base RV32I instructions. On Hazard3, they perform identically to their 32-bit counterparts.

A consequence of the C extension is that 32-bit instructions can be non-naturally-aligned. This has no penalty during sequential execution, but branching to a 32-bit instruction that is not 32-bit-aligned carries a 1 cycle penalty, because the instruction fetch is cracked into two naturally-aligned bus accesses.
